**Customized** is a mod for Minecraft that enhances the cooking system by adding new cooking methods, recipes, and dynamic food buffs. Cook delicious meals with various techniques and gain special buffs!

## Features
- **New Cooking Methods**: Custom cook and more!
- **Food Buffs**: Gain special buffs like walking on powder snow, or removing fire from your body by eating specific dishes.
- **Customizable Recipes**: Modify and create your own recipes.

## Configuration
You can modify the nutritional values, the nutrients they provide, and the corresponding buffs by editing the mod's config files.

## GUI-Free Interaction
The design philosophy of this mod is to minimize the use of GUIs and focus on more natural,
immersive interactions within the game. In Customized, all cooking and food buff-related actions are achieved through simple item interactions,
rather than complex menus. Players only need to place the required ingredients in the right spots to begin cooking and enjoy the benefits of the food.
This approach preserves the core mechanics of Minecraft while enhancing the immersion of the gameplay.
