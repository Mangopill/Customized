Each hundred grams of ingredients corresponds to the nutritional value divided by the corresponding reference value multiplied by one percent.
For example: 100g of apples contain 85g of water, 85g / 1.5g Ã— 1% = 8.5%
"water" -> 1.5g = 1%
"protein" -> 0.5g = 1%
"lipid" -> 0.5g = 1%
"carbohydrate" -> 0.5g = 1%
"vitamin" -> 0.2mg = 1%
"mineral" -> 5mg = 1%
"dietary_fiber" -> 0.2g = 1%
The following nutrients do not have specific specifications; you can assign values by referring to existing examples.
