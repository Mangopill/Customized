# Each hundred grams of ingredients corresponds to the nutritional value divided by the corresponding reference value multiplied by one percent.
# For the food to be cooked, the raw value is usually half of the cooked value.
## For example: 100g of apples contain 85g of water, 85g / 1.5g Ã— 1% = 8.5%
"water" -> **1.5g** = 1% <br>
"protein" -> **0.5g** = 1% <br>
"lipid" -> **0.5g** = 1% <br>
"carbohydrate" -> **0.5g** = 1% <br>
"vitamin" -> **0.2mg** = 1% <br>
"mineral" -> **5mg** = 1% <br>
"dietary_fiber" -> **0.2g** = 1% <br>
The following nutrients do not have specific specifications; you can assign values by referring to existing examples. <br>
