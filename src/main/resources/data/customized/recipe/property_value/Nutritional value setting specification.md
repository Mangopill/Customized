Each hundred grams of ingredients corresponds to the nutritional value divided by the corresponding reference value multiplied by one percent.
For example: 100g of apples contain 85g of water, 85 / 1.5 Ã— 1% = 8.5%
"water" -> 1.5g = 1%
"protein" -> 1.5g = 1%
"lipid" -> 1.5g = 1%
"carbohydrate" -> 1.5g = 1%
"vitamin" -> 1.5g = 1%
"mineral" -> 1.5g = 1%
"dietary_fiber" -> 1.5g = 1%
"cold" -> 1.5g = 1%
"warm" -> 1.5g = 1%
"ecology" -> 1.5g = 1%
"dread" -> 1.5g = 1%
"nothingness" -> 1.5g = 1%
"sour" -> 1.5g = 1%
"sweet" -> 1.5g = 1%
"bitter" -> 1.5g = 1%
"spicy" -> 1.5g = 1%
"salty" -> 1.5g = 1%
"numbing" -> 1.5g = 1%
"fresh" -> 1.5g = 1%
"fragrant" -> 1.5g = 1%
